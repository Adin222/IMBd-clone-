      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Adin Čustović I'm a 22-year-old electrical engineering
        student pursuing an associate degree in software development in
        Sarajevo. Programming has been a passion of mine ever since I was
        introduced to Qbasic in elementary school. I remember making a fun game
        of Pong, and that's when my interest in coding really took off. Games
        have always been a major part of my life, and I became fascinated with
        how they worked. Learning to code gave me a better understanding of what
        goes on behind the scenes and how I could create something on my own. In
        high school, I dabbled a bit in Pascal, but it wasn't until recently
        that I began learning HTML, CSS, and JS. I have a vision to learn
        frameworks such as React.js, which I believe will take my skills to the
        next level. I am truly passionate about front-end development and I
        enjoy every bit of it. I am actively searching for an internship that
        will help me upgrade my programming skills. I also have basic knowledge
        of C/C++.
